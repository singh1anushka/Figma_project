## Mordern Women’s Clothing Website UI Design

A modern, desktop-focused eCommerce UI design tailored for women, highlighting clear layout, elegant typography, and a soothing color palette.

## What I Did

- Designed wireframes and high-level desktop screens in Figma
- Focused on a clean structure, clear navigation, and brand-focused visuals
- Categorized products by type, size, and color to improve discoverability
